# Manual end-to-end verification

Use two isolated browser profiles and two dedicated test Google accounts for cross-user checks. Never use a personal account.

1. Generate a new invitation with `invite:create`.
2. Open `https://review.villow.app` and paste the complete fragment invitation.
3. Sign into an allowlisted test account and grant `youtube.readonly`.
4. Confirm the site shows subscription access connected and a successful refresh timestamp.
5. Generate and copy an extension connect link.
6. Connect the packaged extension and run **Test connection**.
7. Run **Refresh subscriptions** and enable **Hide channels you are subscribed to**.
8. Confirm at least one seeded channel matches by handle/title on a home-feed tile.
9. Save an eligible video from an unsubscribed channel.
10. Confirm the extension receives a success and the video appears newest-first in the review queue.
11. Submit the same video again and confirm duplicate `409` is treated as success.
12. Pair a second reviewer and confirm neither reviewer can read, remove, or query the other's queue/subscriptions.
13. Revoke or expire the first reviewer's Google grant.
14. Confirm `GET /api/subscriptions` returns `503` with exactly `{"message":"Reconnect Google in Villow to refresh your subscriptions."}` and the previous subscription cache remains.
15. While Google remains stale, save another video and confirm it reaches the queue. Inspect Google/YouTube request logs to confirm the save generated no API call.
16. Reconnect Google and confirm subscription refresh recovers without rotating the extension token.
17. Check `POST /api/extension-day` totals after a queue receipt and confirm the new save is included synchronously.
18. Check `GET /api/queue/status` and confirm every returned entry contains boolean `played` and `present`.
19. Remove an unplayed video and confirm it disappears. A repeated delete may return `404`, which the extension treats as success.
20. Revoke the extension token and confirm `GET /api/ping` and queue save return `401`; confirm a Google failure never returns `401`.
21. Test an unlisted extension origin and confirm preflight/requests are rejected without a wildcard CORS header and all responses contain `Vary: Origin`.
22. Confirm `https://villow.app`, its index, and its policy files are unchanged and no review credentials/bindings exist in that deployment.
23. Revoke the invitation/connect link and delete review data after the test.
